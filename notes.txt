HTML :
    1. Main-Container -> container1 and container2
    2. container1 -> hour-block, colon, min-block, colon, sec-block
    3. hour-block -> up-arrow, hour, down-arrow [similar to min and sec block]
    4. container2 -> buttons [start,stop,reset]

JS :
    1. Use querySelector() to select classes and IDs.
    2. Set click events for up/down arrows, start, stop, and reset buttons.
    3. Up arrow for increment and down arrow for decrement (when the timer is not running).
    4. Create a doubleDigit(digit) function to ensure single-digit values are prefixed with '0'.
    5. start button triggers startTimer() if the timer is not running. Use setInterval to decrement time by one second and set timeRunning to true.
    6. startTimer() 
        if sec min and hour is 0 then
            stop the time
            return
        else:
            decrement sec by 1
            if sec is less than 0 then
                if min is greater than 0 then
                    decrement min by 1
                    set sec to 59
                else:
                    if hour is greater than 0:
                        decrement hour by 1
                        set min and sec to 59
        doubleDigit the sec min and hour
        
    7. stop -> set timeRunning to false and clearInterval
    8. reset -> set sec, min, hour to 0
